What is Elastic Load Balancing?
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as
        EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It 
        monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy
        targets. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer capacity automatically in response to changes
        in incoming traffic.
A load balancer distributes workloads across multiple compute resources, such as
            virtual servers. Using a load balancer increases the availability and fault tolerance
            of your applications.
You can add and remove compute resources from your load balancer as your needs 
            change, without disrupting the overall flow of requests to your applications.
You can configure health checks, which monitor the health of the compute resources, so
            that the load balancer sends requests only to the healthy ones. You can also offload the
            work of encryption and decryption to your load balancer so that your compute resources
            can focus on their main work.
