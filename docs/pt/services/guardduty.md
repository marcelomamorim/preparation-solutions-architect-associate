### What is Amazon GuardDuty?

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors, analyzes, and
        processes specific AWS data sources and logs in your AWS environment. 
        GuardDuty uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious
        IP addresses and domains, and machine learning (ML) models to identify unexpected, and potentially
        unauthorized activity in your AWS environment. This includes the following issues:
        

For example, GuardDuty can
        detect potentially compromised EC2 instances and container workloads serving malware, or mining bitcoin.
        It also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of potential compromise, such as unauthorized
        infrastructure deployments â instances deployed in a Region that has not been used
        before, or unusual API calls that suggest a change to the password policy to reduce password strength.

Here are some of the key ways in which Amazon GuardDuty can help you monitor, detect, and 
            manage potential threats in your AWS environment.

GuardDuty supports the processing, storage, and transmission 
of credit card data by a merchant or service provider, and has been 
validated as being compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS). 
For more information about PCI DSS, including how to request a copy of the AWS PCI Compliance Package,
