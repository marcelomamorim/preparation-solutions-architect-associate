### AWS Firewall Manager

AWS Firewall Manager simplifies your administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts
and resources for a variety of protections, including AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, Amazon VPC security groups and network ACLs,
AWS Network Firewall, and Amazon RouteÂ 53 Resolver DNS Firewall. With Firewall Manager, you set up your protections just once
and the service automatically applies them across your accounts and resources, even as you add new accounts and resources. 

Firewall Manager provides these benefits:

Firewall Manager is particularly useful when you want to protect your entire organization rather than a
		small number of specific accounts and resources, or if you frequently add new resources
		that you want to protect. Firewall Manager also provides centralized monitoring of DDoS attacks across
		your organization.
