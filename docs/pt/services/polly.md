What Is Amazon Polly?
Amazon Polly is a cloud service that converts text into lifelike speech. You can use Amazon Polly to
        develop applications that increase engagement and accessibility. Amazon Polly supports multiple
        languages and includes a variety of lifelike voices. With Amazon Polly, you can build
        speech-enabled applications that work in multiple locations and use the ideal voice for your

Amazon Polly offers many voice options, including generative, long-form, neural, and standard
        text-to-speech (TTS) options. These voices deliver ground-breaking improvements in speech
        quality using new machine learning technology to offer the most natural and human-like
        text-to-speech voices possible. Neural TTS technology also supports a Newscaster speaking
        style, tailored to news narration use cases.
