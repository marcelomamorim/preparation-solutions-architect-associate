 What is AWS Device Farm?
Device Farm is an app testing service that you can use to test and interact with your Android,
        iOS, and web apps on real, physical phones and tablets that are hosted by Amazon Web Services
        (AWS).
There are two main ways to use Device Farm:
Device Farm allows you to upload your own tests or use built-in, script-free compatibility
            tests. Because testing is performed in parallel, tests on multiple devices begin in
            minutes.
As tests are completed, a test report that contains high-level results, low-level
            logs, pixel-to-pixel screenshots, and performance data is updated.
