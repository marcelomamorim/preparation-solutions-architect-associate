What is AWS Lambda?
You can use AWS Lambda to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
 Lambda runs your code
    on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources,
    including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and
    logging. With Lambda, all you need to do is supply your code in one of the language runtimes that Lambda supports.
You organize your code into Lambda functions. The Lambda service runs your function only when needed and scales automatically. You only pay for the compute time that you consumeâthere is no charge when your code is not running. For more information, see AWS Lambda Pricing.
Lambda is an ideal compute service for application scenarios that need to scale up rapidly, and scale down to
      zero when not in demand. For example, you can use Lambda for:
