What is AWS Resource Access Manager?
AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) helps you securely share your resources across AWS accounts, within
        your organization or organizational units (OUs), and with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users
        for supported resource types. If you have multiple AWS accounts, you can create a resource
        once and use AWS RAM to make that resource usable by those other accounts. If your account is
        managed by AWS Organizations, you can share resources with all the other accounts in the organization
        or only those accounts contained by one or more specified organizational units (OUs). You
        can also share with specific AWS accounts by account ID, regardless of whether the account
        is part of an organization. Some supported resource types
        also let you share them with specified IAM roles and users.
The following video provides a brief introduction to AWS RAM and describes how to create
            a resource share. For more information, see Creating a resource share in AWS RAM.
The following video demonstrates how to apply AWS managed permissions to your AWS resources. For
