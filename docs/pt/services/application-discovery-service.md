### What is AWS Application Discovery Service?

AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan your migration to the AWS cloud by collecting usage and
        configuration data about your on-premises
        servers and
        databases. Application Discovery Service is integrated with
        AWS Migration Hub and
        AWS Database Migration Service Fleet
        Advisor.
        Migration Hub simplifies your migration tracking as it aggregates your migration status information
        into a single console. You can view the discovered servers, group them into applications,
        and then track the migration status of each application from the Migration Hub console in your
        home Region. You can
        use DMS Fleet Advisor to assess migrations options for database
        workloads.

All discovered data is stored in your AWS Migration Hub home Region. Therefore, you must set
        your home Region in the Migration Hub console or with CLI commands before performing any discovery
        and migration activities. Your data can be exported for analysis in Microsoft Excel or AWS
        analysis tools such as Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight.

Using Application Discovery Service APIs, you can export the system performance and utilization data for your
        discovered servers. Input this data into your cost model to compute the cost of running
        those servers in AWS. Additionally, you can export data about the network connections that
        exist between servers. This information helps you determine the network dependencies between
        servers and group them into applications for migration planning.

Application Discovery Service offers two ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your
        on-premises servers:
