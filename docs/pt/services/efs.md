### What is Amazon Elastic File System?

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides serverless, fully elastic file storage so that you can share file
    data without provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance. Amazon EFS is built to scale
    on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as
    you add and remove files. Because Amazon EFS has a simple web services interface, you can create and
    configure file systems quickly and easily. The service manages all the file storage
    infrastructure for you, meaning that you can avoid the complexity of deploying, patching, and
    maintaining complex file system configurations. 

Amazon EFS supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4.1 and NFSv4.0) protocol, so the
    applications and tools that you use today work seamlessly with Amazon EFS. Amazon EFS is accessible across
    most types of Amazon Web Services compute instances, including Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, AWS Lambda,
    and AWS Fargate. 

The service is designed to be highly scalable, highly available, and highly durable. Amazon EFS
    offers the following file system types to meet your availability and durability needs:
