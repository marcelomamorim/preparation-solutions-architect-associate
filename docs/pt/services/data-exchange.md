### What is AWS Data Exchange?

AWS Data Exchange is a service that helps AWS easily share and manage data entitlements from other
        organizations at scale.

As a data receiver,
        you
        can track and manage all of your data grants and AWS Marketplace data subscriptions in one place. When
        you have access to an AWS Data Exchange data set, you can use compatible AWS or partner analytics and
        machine learning to extract insights from it. For information about purchasing data products
        from AWS Marketplace, see Subscribing to data products on AWS Data Exchange.

For data senders, AWS Data Exchange eliminates the need to build and maintain any data delivery and
        entitlement infrastructure. Anyone with an AWS account can create and send data grants to
        data receivers. To sell your data as a product in AWS Marketplace, make sure that you follow the
        guidelines to determine eligibility. For more information, see Listing data products on AWS Marketplace.

In addition, anyone, with or without an AWS account, can find and use publicly available
        data sets that are part of the Open Data on
            AWS program. For more information, see Using Open Data on AWS data sets.
