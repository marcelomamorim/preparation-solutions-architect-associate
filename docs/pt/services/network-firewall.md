### What is AWS Network Firewall?

AWS Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and
		prevention service for your virtual private cloud (VPC) that you create in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
		(Amazon VPC). 

With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes
		filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or
		AWS Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses the open source intrusion prevention system (IPS), Suricata,
		for stateful inspection. Network Firewall supports Suricata compatible rules. For more
		information, see Working with stateful rule groups in
                                AWS Network Firewall.

You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your Amazon VPC traffic in a number of ways,
		including the following: 

To enable Network Firewall for your VPC, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in
		Network Firewall. For information about managing your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC, see the
                        Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide. For more information about how Network Firewall works,
