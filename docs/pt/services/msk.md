Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) is a fully managed service that
    enables you to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka to process streaming data.
    Amazon MSK provides the control-plane operations, such as those for creating, updating, and
    deleting clusters. It lets you use Apache Kafka data-plane operations, such as those for
    producing and consuming data. It runs open-source versions of Apache Kafka. This means existing
    applications, tooling, and plugins from partners and the Apache Kafka community are supported
    without requiring changes to application code. You can use Amazon MSK to create clusters that use any
    of the Apache Kafka versions listed under Supported Apache Kafka versions.
These components describe the architecture of Amazon MSK:
