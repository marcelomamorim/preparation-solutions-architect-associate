### What is Amazon EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web
		Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy
		applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you
		need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up)
		to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website
		traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.

An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. When you launch an EC2 instance,
    	the instance type that you specify determines the hardware available to your instance. 
    	Each instance type offers a different balance of compute, memory, network, and storage 
    	resources. For more information, see the Amazon EC2 Instance Types Guide.

Amazon EC2 provides the following high-level features:

Amazon EC2 supports the processing, storage, and transmission 
of credit card data by a merchant or service provider, and has been 
validated as being compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS). 
For more information about PCI DSS, including how to request a copy of the AWS PCI Compliance Package, 
see PCI DSS Level 1.
