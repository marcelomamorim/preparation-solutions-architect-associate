What are AWS Cost and Usage Reports?
The AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of cost and usage data available. You can use Cost and Usage Reports to publish your AWS billing reports to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
     bucket that you own. You can receive reports that break down your costs by
     the hour, day, or month, by product or product resource, or by tags that you
     define yourself. AWS updates the report in your bucket once a day in
     comma-separated value (CSV) format. You can view the reports using
     spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Apache OpenOffice Calc, or
     access them from an application using the Amazon S3 API. 
AWS Cost and Usage Reports tracks your AWS usage and provides estimated charges associated with your account. Each report contains line items for each unique combination of AWS products, usage type, and operation that you use in your AWS account. You can customize the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to aggregate the information either by the hour, day, or month.
AWS Cost and Usage Reports can do the following:
After you create a Cost and Usage Report, AWS sends your report to the Amazon S3 bucket that you
      specify. AWS updates your report at least once a day until your charges are
      finalized.
