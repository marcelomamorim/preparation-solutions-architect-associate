What is AWS Backup?
AWS Backup is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to centralize and automate data
    protection across AWS services, in the cloud, and on premises. Using this service, you can
    configure backup policies and monitor activity for your AWS resources in one place. It allows
    you to automate and consolidate backup tasks that were previously performed service-by-service,
    and removes the need to create custom scripts and manual processes. With a few clicks in the
    AWS Backup console, you can automate your data protection policies and schedules.
AWS Backup does not govern backups you take in your AWS environment outside of AWS Backup.
    Therefore, if you want a centralized, end-to-end solution for business and regulatory compliance
    requirements, start using AWS Backup today.
AWS Backup provides many features and capabilities, including the following.
AWS Backup provides a centralized backup console, a set of backup APIs, and the AWS Command Line Interface
        (AWS CLI) to manage backups across the AWS services that your applications use. With AWS Backup,
        you can centrally manage backup policies that meet your backup requirements. You can then
        apply them to your AWS resources across AWS services, enabling you to back up your
        application data in a consistent and compliant manner. The AWS Backup centralized backup console
        offers a consolidated view of your backups and backup activity logs, making it easier to
        audit your backups and ensure compliance.
