### What is Amazon ElastiCache for Redis?

Welcome to the Amazon ElastiCache for Redis User Guide. Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes
		it easy to set up, manage, and scale a distributed in-memory data store or cache environment
		in the cloud. It provides a high-performance, scalable, and cost-effective caching solution.
		At the same time, it helps remove the complexity associated with deploying and managing a
		distributed cache environment.

You can operate Amazon ElastiCache in two formats. You can get started with a serverless cache or 
		choose to design your own cache cluster. 

ElastiCache for Redis offers serverless caching, which simplifies adding and operating a Redis-based cache 
			for your application. ElastiCache for Redis Serverless enables you to create a highly available cache in under a 
			minute, and eliminates the need to provision instances or configure nodes or clusters. Developers 
			can create a Serverless cache by specifying the cache name using the ElastiCache console, SDK or CLI. 

ElastiCache for Redis Serverless also removes the need to plan and manage caching capacity. ElastiCache for Redis constantly monitors 
			the cacheâs memory, compute, and network bandwidth used by your application, and scales to meet the 
			needs of your application. ElastiCache for Redis offers a simple endpoint experience for developers, by abstracting the 
			underlying cache infrastructure and cluster design. ElastiCache for Redis manages hardware provisioning, monitoring, 
			node replacements, and software patching automatically and transparently, so that you can focus on 
			application development, rather than operating the cache.
