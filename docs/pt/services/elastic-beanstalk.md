What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) comprises over one hundred services, each of which exposes an area of
    functionality. While the variety of services offers flexibility for how you want to manage your
    AWS infrastructure, it can be challenging to figure out which services to use and how to
    provision them.
With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn
    about the infrastructure that runs those applications. Elastic Beanstalk reduces management
    complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk
    automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and
    application health monitoring.
Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
    When you deploy your application, Elastic Beanstalk builds the selected supported platform version and
    provisions one or more AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, to run your application.
You can interact with Elastic Beanstalk by using the Elastic Beanstalk console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or eb, a high-level CLI designed specifically for
    Elastic Beanstalk.
