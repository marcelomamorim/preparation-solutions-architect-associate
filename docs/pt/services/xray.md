### What is AWS X-Ray?

AWS X-Ray provides trace information about any received responses and calls that an
    instrumented application makes, including to the following:

Use trace data and visualizations to gain insights into your application's performance,
    identify issues, and find opportunities for optimization. Use analysis tools in X-Ray to view,
    filter, and investigate details for any traced request to your application.

To use X-Ray, you must first instrument your application so that X-Ray can track how
      your application handles a request. Adding instrumentation to your application lets X-Ray
      send trace data and metadata for incoming and outbound requests and other events within your
      application. For example, you can instrument all incoming HTTP requests and downstream calls
      to AWS services that your Java application makes. You can also instrument your application
      automatically. For more information, see Instrumenting your application for more information.

X-Ray assigns a trace id to any request that your instrumented application receives. If
      your application interacts with another component, X-Ray creates a segment. This segment is
      associated with the original trace id and tracks the quality of the interaction with that
      component.
