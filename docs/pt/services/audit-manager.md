What is AWS Audit Manager?
Welcome to the AWS Audit Manager User
    Guide.
AWS Audit Manager helps you continually audit your AWS usage to simplify how you manage risk and
    compliance with regulations and industry standards. Audit Manager automates evidence collection so you
    can more easily assess whether your policies, procedures, and activitiesâalso known as controlsâare operating effectively. When it's time for an audit, Audit Manager
    helps you manage stakeholder reviews of your controls. This means that you can build audit-ready
    reports with much less manual effort.
Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate assessments for a given
    compliance standard or regulation. Frameworks include a prebuilt collection of controls with
    descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are grouped according to the requirements of
    the specified compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls
    to support internal audits according to your specific requirements. 
You can create an assessment from any framework. When you create an assessment, Audit Manager
    automatically runs resource assessments. These assessments collect data for the AWS accounts
    that you define as in scope for your audit. The data that's collected is automatically
    transformed into audit-friendly evidence. Then, it's attached to the relevant controls to help
    you demonstrate compliance in security, change management, business continuity, and software
    licensing. This evidence collection process is ongoing, and starts when you create your
    assessment. After you complete an audit and you no longer need Audit Manager to collect evidence, you can
    stop evidence collection. To do this, change the status of your assessment to inactive.
