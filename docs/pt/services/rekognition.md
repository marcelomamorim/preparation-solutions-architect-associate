What is Amazon Rekognition?
Amazon Rekognition is a cloud-based image and video analysis service that makes it easy to add
        advanced computer vision capabilities to your applications. The service is powered by proven
        deep learning technology and it requires no machine learning expertise to use. Amazon Rekognition
        includes a simple, easy-to-use API that can quickly analyze any image or video file thatâs
        stored in Amazon S3.
You can add features that detect objects, text, unsafe content, analyze images/videos, and
        compare faces to your application using Rekognition's APIs. With Amazon Rekognition's face
        recognition APIs, you can detect, analyze, and compare faces for a wide variety of use
        cases, including user verification, cataloging, people counting, and public safety.
The service is based on the same proven, highly scalable, deep learning technology
        developed by Amazonâs computer vision scientists, technology that can analyze billions of
        images and videos daily. Rekognition routinely learns from new data, and we frequently add
        new labels and features to the service.
