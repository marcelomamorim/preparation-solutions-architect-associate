What is Amazon Aurora?
Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. You already know
        how MySQL and PostgreSQL combine the speed and reliability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and
        cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. The code, tools, and applications you use today with your existing MySQL and PostgreSQL
        databases can be used with Aurora. With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three
        times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications.
Aurora includes a high-performance storage subsystem. Its MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible database engines are customized to take
        advantage of that fast distributed storage. The underlying storage grows automatically as needed. An Aurora cluster volume can grow
        to a maximum size of 128 tebibytes (TiB). Aurora also automates and standardizes database clustering and replication, which are
        typically among the most challenging aspects of database configuration and administration.
Aurora is part of the managed database service Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). Amazon RDS makes it easier to set up, operate, and
      scale a relational database in the cloud. If you are not already familiar with Amazon RDS, see the 
      Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide. To learn more about the
      variety of database options available on Amazon Web Services, see 
      Choosing the right 
      database for your organization on AWS.
Amazon RDS is responsible for hosting the software components and infrastructure of DB instances and DB 
            clusters. You are responsible for query tuning, which is the process of adjusting SQL queries to improve 
            performance. Query performance is highly dependent on database design, data size, data distribution, 
            application workload, and query patterns, which can vary greatly. Monitoring and tuning are highly 
            individualized processes that you own for your RDS databases. You can use Amazon RDS Performance Insights and other tools to 
            identify problematic queries.
