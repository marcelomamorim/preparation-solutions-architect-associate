### What is Amazon Inspector Classic?

Amazon Inspector Classic tests the network accessibility of your Amazon EC2 instances and the security state of your applications that run on those instances.
        Amazon Inspector Classic assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector Classic produces a
        detailed list of security findings that is organized by level of severity. 

With Amazon Inspector Classic, you can automate security vulnerability assessments throughout your development and deployment pipelines or for static production
        systems. This allows you to make security testing a regular part of development and IT operations. 

Amazon Inspector Classic also offers predefined software called an agent that you can optionally install in the operating system of the
        EC2 instances that you want to assess. The agent monitors the behavior of the EC2 instances, including network, file system, and process activity. It also
        collects a wide set of behavior and configuration data (telemetry).
