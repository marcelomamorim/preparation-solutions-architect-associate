### What is AWS Compute Optimizer?

AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes your AWS
    resources' configuration and utilization metrics to provide you with rightsizing recommendations. 
    It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization
    recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also
    provides graphs showing recent utilization metric history data, as well as projected utilization
    for recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best
    price-performance trade-off. The analysis and visualization of your usage patterns can help you
    decide when to move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and
    capacity requirements.

Compute Optimizer provides a console
      experience, and a set of APIs
    that allows you to view the findings of the analysis and recommendations for your resources
    across multiple AWS Regions. You can also view findings and recommendations across multiple
    accounts, if you opt in the management account of an organization. The findings from the service
    are also reported in the consoles of the supported services, such as the Amazon EC2 console.

Compute Optimizer generates recommendations for the following resources:

For Compute Optimizer to generate recommendations for these resources, they must meet a specific set of
      requirements, and must have accumulated sufficient metric data. For more information, see
        Supported resources and requirements.
