What is AWS License Manager?
AWS License Manager is a service that makes it easier for you to manage your software licenses from
		software vendors (for example, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, and IBM) centrally across AWS and your
		on-premises environments. This provides control and visibility into the usage of your licenses,
		enabling you to limit licensing overages and reduce the risk of non-compliance and
		misreporting.
As you build out your cloud infrastructure on AWS, you can save costs by using Bring Your
		Own License model (BYOL) opportunities. That is, you can re-purpose your existing license
		inventory for use with your cloud resources.
License Manager reduces the risk of licensing overages and penalties with inventory tracking that is
		tied directly into AWS services. With rule-based controls on the consumption of licenses,
		administrators can set hard or soft limits on new and existing cloud deployments. Based on these
		limits, License Manager helps stop non-compliant server usage before it happens.
License Manager's built-in dashboards provide ongoing visibility into license usage and assistance
		with vendor audits.
