What is Amazon Comprehend?
Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights about the content of documents. It develops insights by recognizing the entities, key phrases, language, sentiments, and other common
    elements in a document. Use Amazon Comprehend to create new products based on understanding the structure of documents. For
    example, using Amazon Comprehend you can search social networking feeds for mentions of products or scan an entire document
    repository for key phrases.
You can access Amazon Comprehend document analysis capabilities using the Amazon Comprehend console or using the Amazon Comprehend APIs.
    You can run real-time analysis for small workloads or you can start asynchronous analysis jobs for large document
    sets. You can use the pre-trained models that Amazon Comprehend provides, or you can train your own custom models for
    classification and entity recognition.
Amazon Comprehend may store your content to continuously improve the quality
    of its pre-trained models. See the Amazon Comprehend FAQ to learn more. 
All of the Amazon Comprehend features accept UTF-8 text documents as the input. In addition, custom classification
    and custom entity recognition accept image files, PDF files, and Word files as input.
