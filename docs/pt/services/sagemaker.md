### What is Amazon SageMaker?

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning (ML) service. With SageMaker, data scientists and
    developers can quickly and confidently build, train, and deploy ML models into a
    production-ready hosted environment. It provides a UI experience for running ML workflows that
    makes SageMaker ML tools available across multiple integrated development environments (IDEs). 

With SageMaker, you can store and share your data without having to build and manage your own
    servers. This gives you or your organizations more time to collaboratively build and develop
    your ML workflow, and do it sooner. SageMaker provides managed ML algorithms to run efficiently
    against extremely large data in a distributed environment. With built-in support for
    bring-your-own-algorithms and frameworks, SageMaker offers flexible distributed training options that
    adjust to your specific workflows. Within a few steps, you can deploy a model into a secure and
    scalable environment from the SageMaker console.
