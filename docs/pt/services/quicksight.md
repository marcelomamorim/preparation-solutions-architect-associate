What is Amazon QuickSight?
Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-scale business intelligence (BI) service that you can use to deliver
        easy-to-understand insights to the people who you work with, wherever they are. Amazon QuickSight
        connects to your data in the cloud and combines data from many different sources. In a
        single data dashboard, QuickSight can include AWS data, third-party data, big data,
        spreadsheet data, SaaS data, B2B data, and more. As a fully managed cloud-based service,
        Amazon QuickSight provides enterprise-grade security, global availability, and built-in redundancy.
