### What Is Amazon Lex?

Amazon Lex is an AWS service for building conversational interfaces for applications using
        voice and text. With Amazon Lex, the same conversational engine that powers Amazon Alexa is
        now available to any developer, enabling you to build sophisticated, natural language
        chatbots into your new and existing applications. Amazon Lex provides the deep functionality
        and flexibility of natural language understanding (NLU) and automatic speech recognition
        (ASR) so you can build highly engaging user experiences with lifelike, conversational
        interactions, and create new categories of products.

Amazon Lex enables any developer to build conversational chatbots quickly. With Amazon Lex,
        no deep learning expertise is necessaryâto create a bot, you just specify the basic
        conversation flow in the Amazon Lex console. Amazon Lex manages the dialogue and dynamically
        adjusts the responses in the conversation. Using the console, you can build, test, and
        publish your text or voice chatbot. You can then add the conversational interfaces to bots
        on mobile devices, web applications, and chat platforms (for example, Facebook Messenger). 

Amazon Lex provides pre-built integration with AWS Lambda, and you can easily integrate with
        many other services on the AWS platform, including Amazon Cognito, AWS Mobile Hub, Amazon CloudWatch, and
        Amazon DynamoDB. Integration with Lambda provides bots access to pre-built serverless enterprise
        connectors to link to data in SaaS applications, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, or
        Marketo.
