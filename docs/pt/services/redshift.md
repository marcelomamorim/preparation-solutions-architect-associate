### What is Amazon Redshift?

Welcome to the Amazon Redshift Management Guide. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed,
        petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. Amazon Redshift Serverless lets you access and
        analyze data without all of the configurations of a provisioned data warehouse. Resources
        are automatically provisioned and data warehouse capacity is intelligently scaled to deliver
        fast performance for even the most demanding and unpredictable workloads. You don't incur
        charges when the data warehouse is idle, so you only pay for what you use. You can load data
        and start querying right away in the Amazon Redshift query editor v2 or in your favorite business
        intelligence (BI) tool. Enjoy the best price performance and familiar SQL features in an
        easy-to-use, zero administration environment.

Regardless of the size of the dataset, Amazon Redshift offers fast query performance using
        the same SQL-based tools and business intelligence applications that you use today.

 If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the
            following sections: 

If you prefer to manage your Amazon Redshift resources manually, you can create provisioned
            clusters for your data querying needs. For more information, see Amazon Redshift
                clusters.
