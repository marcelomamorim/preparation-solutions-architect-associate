What Is AWS Batch?
AWS Batch helps you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for
  developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch removes the
  undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure, similar to traditional batch
  computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to
  eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly.
As a fully managed service, AWS Batch helps you to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch
  automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of
  the workloads. With AWS Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software, so you can focus your time
  on analyzing results and solving problems.
AWS Batch simplifies running batch jobs across multiple Availability Zones within a Region. You can create AWS Batch
   compute environments within a new or existing VPC. After a compute environment is up and associated with a job queue,
   you can define job definitions that specify which Docker container images to run your jobs. Container images are
   stored in and pulled from container registries, which may exist within or outside of your AWS
   infrastructure.
A unit of work (such as a shell script, a Linux executable, or a Docker container image) that you submit to
    AWS Batch. It has a name, and runs as a containerized application on AWS Fargate or Amazon EC2 resources in your compute
    environment, using parameters that you specify in a job definition. Jobs can reference other jobs by name or by ID,
    and can be dependent on the successful completion of other jobs. For more information, see Jobs.
