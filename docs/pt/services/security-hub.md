### What is AWS Security Hub?

AWS Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in AWS and helps you assess your AWS environment against security industry
        standards and best practices.

Security Hub collects security data across AWS accounts, AWS services, and supported third-party products and helps you analyze your security
        trends and identify the highest priority security issues.

To help you manage the security state of your organization, Security Hub supports multiple security standards. These include
the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) standard developed by AWS, and external compliance frameworks such as 
the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST). Each standard includes several security controls, each of which represents a security best practice. 
Security Hub runs checks against security controls and generates control findings to help you assess your compliance against security best practices.

In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub also receives findings from other AWS servicesâsuch as Amazon GuardDuty, 
Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macieâ and supported third-party 
products. This gives you a single pane of glass into a variety of security-related issues. You can also send Security Hub findings to other 
AWS services and supported third-party products.
