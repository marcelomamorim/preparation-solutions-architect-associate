### What is Amazon Cognito?

Amazon Cognito is an identity platform for web and mobile apps. Itâs a user directory, an
    authentication server, and an authorization service for OAuth 2.0 access tokens and AWS
    credentials. With Amazon Cognito, you can authenticate and authorize users from the built-in user
    directory, from your enterprise directory, and from consumer identity providers like Google and
    Facebook.

The two components that follow make up Amazon Cognito. They operate independently or in tandem, based
    on your access needs for your users.

Create a user pool when you want to authenticate and authorize users to your app or API.
      User pools are a user directory with both self-service and administrator-driven user creation,
      management, and authentication. Your user pool can be an independent directory and OIDC
      identity provider (IdP), and an intermediate service provider (SP) to third-party providers of
      workforce and customer identities. You can provide single sign-on (SSO) in your app for your
      organization's workforce identities in SAML 2.0 and OIDC IdPs with user pools. You can also
      provide SSO in your app for your organization's customer identities in the public OAuth 2.0
      identity stores Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook. For more information about customer
      identity and access management (CIAM), see What is CIAM?.

User pools donât require integration with an identity pool. From a user pool, you can
      issue authenticated JSON web tokens (JWTs) directly to an app, a web server, or an API.
