What is Amazon MQ?
Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service that makes it easy to migrate to a message
        broker in the cloud. A message broker allows software applications and
        components to communicate using various programming languages, operating systems, and formal
        messaging protocols. Currently, Amazon MQ supports Apache ActiveMQ Classic and RabbitMQ engine types.
Amazon MQ works with your existing applications and services without the need to manage,
        operate, or maintain your own messaging system.
Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service that provides compatibility with many
            popular message brokers. We recommend Amazon MQ for migrating applications from existing
            message brokers that rely on compatibility with APIs such as JMS or protocols such as
            AMQP 0-9-1, AMQP 1.0, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP.
Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS are queue and topic services that are highly scalable, simple to use,
            and don't require you to set up message brokers. We recommend these services for new
            applications that can benefit from nearly unlimited scalability and simple APIs.
