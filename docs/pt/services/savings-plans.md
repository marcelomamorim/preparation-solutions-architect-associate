### What are Savings Plans?

Savings Plans offer a flexible pricing model that provides savings on AWS usage. You
  can save up to 72 percent on your AWS compute workloads. Compute Savings Plans provide lower prices on
  Amazon EC2 instance usage regardless of instance family, size, OS, tenancy, or AWS Region. This also
  applies to AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda usage. SageMaker Savings Plans provide you with lower prices for your
  Amazon SageMaker instance usage, regardless of your instance family, size, component, or AWS Region. 

Savings Plans provide savings beyond On-Demand rates in exchange for a commitment of using a
  specified amount of compute power (measured per hour) for a one or three year period.

You can manage your plans by using recommendations, performance reporting, and budget alerts
  in AWS Cost Explorer.

When you sign up for Savings Plans, the prices you'll pay for usage stays the same through the plan
  term. You can pay for your commitment using All upfront, Partial
   upfront, or No upfront payment options.
