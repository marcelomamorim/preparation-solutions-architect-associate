### What is AWS Health?

AWS Health provides ongoing visibility into your resource performance and the
        availability of your AWS services and accounts. You can use AWS Health
            events to learn how service and resource changes might affect your
        applications running on AWS. AWS Health provides relevant and timely information to help
        you manage events in progress. AWS Health also helps you be aware of and to prepare for
        planned activities. The service delivers alerts and notifications triggered by changes in
        the health of AWS resources, so that you get near-instant event visibility and
        guidance to help accelerate troubleshooting.

All customers can use the AWS Health Dashboard, powered by the AWS Health API. The dashboard
        requires no setup, and it's ready to use for authenticated AWS users. For more service highlights, see the AWS Health Dashboard detail
            page.
