What Is Amazon Forecast?
Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service that uses statistical and machine learning algorithms
    to deliver highly accurate time-series forecasts. Based on the same technology used for
    time-series forecasting at Amazon.com, Forecast provides state-of-the-art algorithms to predict
    future time-series data based on historical data, and requires no machine learning
    experience.
Time-series forecasting is useful in multiple fields, including retail, finance, logistics,
    and healthcare. You can also use Forecast to predict domain-specific metrics for your
    inventory, workforce, web traffic, server capacity, and finances.

You can use the APIs, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), Python
