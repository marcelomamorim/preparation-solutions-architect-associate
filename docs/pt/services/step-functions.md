### What is AWS Step Functions?

AWS Step Functions is a visual workflow service that helps you build distributed applications, automate processes, orchestrate microservices, and create data and machine learning (ML) pipelines.

In the Step Functions' graphical console, you can see your applicationâs workflow as a series of event-driven steps.

Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks. In Step Functions, state machines are called workflows, which are a series of event-driven steps. Each step in a workflow is called a state. For example, a Task state represents a unit of work that another AWS service performs, such as calling another AWS service or API.

With Step Functions' built-in controls, you can examine the state of each step in your workflow to
    make sure that your application runs in order and as expected. Depending on your use case, you
    can have Step Functions call AWS services, such as Lambda, to perform tasks. You can create workflows
    that process and publish machine learning models. You can have Step Functions control AWS services,
    such as AWS Glue, to create extract, transform, and load
    (ETL) workflows. You also can create long-running, automated workflows for applications that
    require human interaction.
