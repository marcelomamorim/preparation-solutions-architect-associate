### What is Amazon Kendra?

Amazon Kendra is an intelligent search service that uses natural language processing
        and advanced machine learning algorithms to return specific answers to search questions from
        your data.

Unlike traditional keyword-based search, Amazon Kendra uses its semantic and
        contextual understanding capabilities to decide whether a document is relevant to a search
        query. It returns specific answers to questions, giving users an experience that's close to
        interacting with a human expert.

With Amazon Kendra, you can create a unified search experience by connecting multiple
        data repositories to an index and ingesting and crawling documents. You can use your
        document metadata to create a feature-rich and customized search experience for your users,
        helping them efficiently find the right answers to their queries.

You can ask Amazon Kendra the following types of queries:
