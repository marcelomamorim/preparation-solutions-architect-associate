### What Is AWS CloudTrail?

AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable operational and risk auditing,
        governance, and compliance of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS
        service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console,
        AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.

CloudTrail is active in your AWS account when you create it. When activity occurs in your
        AWS account, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event.

CloudTrail provides three ways to record events:

Visibility into your AWS account activity is a key aspect of security and operational
        best practices. You can use CloudTrail to view, search, download, archive, analyze, and respond to
        account activity across your AWS infrastructure. You can identify who or what took which
        action, what resources were acted upon, when the event occurred, and other details to help
        you analyze and respond to activity in your AWS account.
