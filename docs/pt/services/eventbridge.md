What Is Amazon EventBridge?
EventBridge is a serverless service that uses events to connect application components together,
    making it easier for you to build scalable event-driven applications. Event-driven architecture
    is a style of building loosely-coupled software systems that work together by emitting and
    responding to events. Event-driven architecture can help you boost agility and build reliable,
    scalable applications. 
Use EventBridge to route events from sources such as home-grown applications, AWS services, and
    third-party software to consumer applications across your organization. EventBridge provides simple and
    consistent ways to ingest, filter, transform, and deliver events so you can build applications
    quickly.
The following video provides a brief introduction to the features of Amazon EventBridge: 
EventBridge includes two ways to process events: event buses and
    pipes.
