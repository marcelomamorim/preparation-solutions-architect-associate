### What Is AWS Control Tower?

AWS Control Tower offers a straightforward way to set up and govern an AWS multi-account environment,
  following prescriptive best practices. AWS Control Tower orchestrates
  the capabilities of several other AWS services, including 
  AWS Organizations, AWS Service Catalog, and AWS IAM Identity Center, to build a landing zone in less than
  an hour. Resources are set up and managed on your behalf. 

AWS Control Tower orchestration extends the capabilities of AWS Organizations. To help keep your
  organizations and accounts from drift, which is divergence from
  best practices, AWS Control Tower applies controls (sometimes called guardrails). For example, you
  can use controls to help ensure that security logs and necessary cross-account access
  permissions are created, and not altered.

If you are hosting more than a handful of accounts, itâs beneficial to have an orchestration
  layer that facilitates account deployment and account governance. You can adopt AWS Control Tower as your
  primary way to provision accounts and infrastructure. With AWS Control Tower, you can more easily adhere to
  corporate standards, meet regulatory requirements, and follow best practices.

AWS Control Tower enables end users on your distributed teams to provision new AWS accounts quickly,
  by means of configurable account templates in Account Factory. Meanwhile, your central cloud
  administrators can monitor that all accounts are aligned with established, company-wide compliance
  policies.
