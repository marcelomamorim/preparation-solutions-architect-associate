What Is AWS Config?
AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS
        account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were
        configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change
        over time. 
An AWS resource is an entity you can work with in AWS, such as an
        Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, a security group, or an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
        (VPC). For a complete list of AWS resources supported by AWS Config, see Supported Resource Types.
When you run your applications on AWS, you usually use AWS resources, which you
            must create and manage collectively. As the demand for your application keeps growing,
            so does your need to keep track of your AWS resources. AWS Config is designed to help you
            oversee your application resources in the following scenarios: 
To exercise better governance over your resource configurations and to detect
                resource misconfigurations, you need fine-grained visibility into what resources
                exist and how these resources are configured at any time. You can use AWS Config to notify
                you whenever resources are created, modified, or deleted without having to monitor
                these changes by polling the calls made to each resource.
