What is Amazon DynamoDB?

        Amazon DynamoDB is a serverless, NoSQL, fully managed database with single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
    

        DynamoDB addresses your needs to overcome scaling and operational complexities of relational databases. DynamoDB is purpose-built and optimized for operational
        workloads that require consistent performance at any scale. For example, DynamoDB delivers consistent single-digit millisecond performance for a shopping cart 
        use case, whether you've 10 or 100 million users.
        Launched in 2012, 
        DynamoDB continues to help you move away from relational databases while reducing cost and improving performance at scale.
    

        Customers across all sizes, industries, and geographies use DynamoDB to build modern, serverless applications that can start small and scale globally. DynamoDB scales to support tables of virtually any size while providing consistent single-digit millisecond performance and high availability.
    

        For events, such as Amazon Prime Day, DynamoDB powers multiple high-traffic Amazon properties and systems,
        including Alexa, Amazon.com sites, and all Amazon fulfillment centers.
        For such events, DynamoDB APIs have handled trillions of calls from Amazon properties and systems. DynamoDB continuously serves hundreds of customers with tables that have peak traffic of over half a million requests per second. It 
        also serves hundreds of customers whose table sizes exceed 200 TB, and processes over one billion requests per hour.
