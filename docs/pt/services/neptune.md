What Is Amazon Neptune?
Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy
    to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of Neptune is
    a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine. This engine is optimized for storing
    billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Neptune supports
    the popular property-graph query languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and Neo4j's openCypher, 
    and the W3C's RDF query language, SPARQL. This enables you to build queries that efficiently
    navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases such as recommendation
    engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network security. 
The Neptune database is highly available, with read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup
    to Amazon S3, and replication across Availability Zones. Neptune provides data security features,
    with support for encryption at rest and in transit. Neptune is fully managed, so you no longer
    need to worry about database management tasks like hardware provisioning, software patching,
    setup, configuration, or backups.
Neptune
    Analytics; is an analytics database engine that complements Neptune database and
    that can quickly analyze large amounts of graph data in memory to get insights and find trends.
