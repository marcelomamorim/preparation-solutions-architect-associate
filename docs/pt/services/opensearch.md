### What is Amazon OpenSearch Service?

Amazon OpenSearch Service is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale
        OpenSearch clusters in the AWS Cloud. Amazon OpenSearch Service supports OpenSearch and legacy
        Elasticsearch OSS (up to 7.10, the final open source version of the software). When you
        create a cluster, you have the option of which search engine to use.

OpenSearch is a
        fully open-source search and analytics engine for use cases such as log analytics, real-time
        application monitoring, and clickstream analysis. For more information, see the OpenSearch documentation.

Amazon OpenSearch Service provisions
        all the resources for your OpenSearch cluster and launches it. It also automatically
        detects and replaces failed OpenSearch Service nodes, reducing the overhead associated with self-managed
        infrastructures. You can scale your cluster with a single API call or a few clicks in the
        console.

To get started using OpenSearch Service, you create an OpenSearch Service domain,
        which is equivalent to an OpenSearch cluster. Each EC2 instance in
        the cluster acts as one OpenSearch Service node.
