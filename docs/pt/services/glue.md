### What is AWS Glue?


        AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy for
        analytics users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources. You
        can use it for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It also includes additional 
        productivity and data ops tooling for authoring, running jobs, and implementing business workflows.
    


        With AWS Glue, you can discover and connect to more than 70 diverse data
        sources and manage your data in a centralized data catalog. You can visually create, run,
        and monitor extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines to load data into your data lakes.
        Also, you can immediately search and query cataloged data using Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and
        Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

    


        AWS Glue consolidates major data integration capabilities into a single service.
        These include data discovery, modern ETL, cleansing, transforming, and centralized
        cataloging. It's also serverless, which means there's no infrastructure to manage. 
        With flexible support for all workloads like ETL, ELT, and streaming in one service,
        AWS Glue supports users across various workloads and types of users.
    


        Also, AWS Glue makes it easy to integrate data
        across your architecture. It integrates with AWS analytics services and Amazon S3 data lakes. 
        AWS Glue has integration interfaces and job-authoring tools that are easy to
        use for all users, from developers to business users, with tailored solutions for varied
        technical skill sets.
