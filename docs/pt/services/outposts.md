### What is AWS Outposts?

AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and
    tools to customer premises. By providing local access to AWS managed infrastructure, AWS Outposts
    enables customers to build and run applications on premises using the same programming
    interfaces as in AWS Regions, while using local compute and storage resources for lower
    latency and local data processing needs.

An Outpost is a pool of AWS compute and storage capacity deployed at a
    customer site. AWS operates, monitors, and manages this capacity as part of an AWS Region.
    You can create subnets on your Outpost and specify them when you create AWS resources such as
    EC2 instances, EBS volumes, ECS clusters, and RDS instances. Instances in Outpost subnets
    communicate with other instances in the AWS Region using private IP addresses, all within the
    same VPC.

For more information, see the AWS Outposts product
      page.
