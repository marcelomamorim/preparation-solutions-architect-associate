What Is Amazon Kinesis Data Streams?
You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process large streams of data records in real time. You
		can create data-processing applications, known as Kinesis Data Streams applications. A
		typical Kinesis Data Streams application reads data from a data stream as data
		records. These applications can use the Kinesis Client Library, and they can run on Amazon EC2
		instances. You can send the processed records to dashboards, use them to generate alerts,
		dynamically change pricing and advertising strategies, or send data to a variety of other
		AWS services. For information about Kinesis Data Streams features and pricing, see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.
Kinesis Data Streams is part of the Kinesis streaming data platform, along with Firehose, Kinesis Video Streams, and Managed Service for Apache Flink.

You can use Kinesis Data Streams for rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation. The type of
			data used can include IT infrastructure log data, application logs, social media, market
			data feeds, and web clickstream data. Because the response time for the data intake and
			processing is in real time, the processing is typically lightweight.
