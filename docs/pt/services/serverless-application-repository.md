What Is the AWS Serverless Application Repository?
The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find, deploy, and
        publish serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless
        applications, see Serverless Computing and
            Applications on the AWS website.
You can easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or
        privately within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application
        (or app), you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS SAM command line interface (AWS SAM CLI), or AWS
        SDKs to upload your code. Along with your code, you upload a simple manifest file, also
        known as an AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template. For more information about AWS SAM, see the AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide.
The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console. This integration means that
        developers of all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn
        anything new. You can use category keywords to browse for applications such as web and
        mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots. You can also search for
        applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose
        it, configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks.
