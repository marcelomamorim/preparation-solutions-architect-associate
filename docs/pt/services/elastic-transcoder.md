What is Amazon Elastic Transcoder?
Amazon Elastic Transcoder lets you convert media files that you have stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) into media files in the formats required by 
		consumer playback devices. For example, you can convert large, high-quality digital media files into formats that users can 
		play back on mobile devices, tablets, web browsers, and connected televisions.
Elastic Transcoder has four components:
Pipelines and jobs are closely associated with specific regions. When you create pipelines and jobs, 
    		they're created in the current region. When you create a new job, you must specify a pipeline in the current region.
You can specify Amazon S3 buckets in a different region than your Elastic Transcoder resources, but we don't recommend it 
    		because you'll incur additional charges for transferring files between AWS regions.
