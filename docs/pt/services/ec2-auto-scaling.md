### What is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to
		handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called
			Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum number of instances in
		each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. You can
		specify the maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your
		group never goes above this size. If you specify the desired capacity, either when you
		create the group or at any time thereafter, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group has this many
		instances. If you specify scaling policies, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can launch or terminate instances
		as demand on your application increases or decreases.

For example, the following Auto Scaling group has a minimum size of four instances, a desired
		capacity of six instances, and a maximum size of twelve instances. The scaling policies that
		you define adjust the number of instances, within your minimum and maximum number of
		instances, based on the criteria that you specify.

With Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, your EC2 instances are organized into Auto Scaling groups so that they can be
			treated as a logical unit for the purposes of scaling and management. Auto Scaling groups use
			launch templates (or launch configurations) as configuration templates for their EC2
			instances.
