What is Amazon Transcribe?
Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition service that uses machine learning 
        models to convert audio to text. You can use Amazon Transcribe as a standalone transcription 
        service or to add speech-to-text capabilities to any application.
With Amazon Transcribe, you can improve accuracy for your specific use case with language 
        customization, filter content to ensure customer privacy or audience-appropriate language, analyze 
        content in multi-channel audio, partition the speech of individual speakers, and more.
You can transcribe media in real time (streaming) or you can transcribe media files located in 
        an Amazon S3 bucket (batch). To see which languages are supported for each type of 
        transcription, refer to the Supported languages and language-specific features table.
